You can use this medicated shampoo as you would use a regular shampoo by massaging it into your skin. Follow the label for directions on how long you should let the product set before rinsing it off.</div>
                <div class="guide" id="guide-6"><h3>Guide</h3>How to use ketoconazole cream
														<br>	1. Wash and dry the infected area of skin. If you're treating your feet, make sure you dry between your toes.
														<br>	2. Use your own towel or flannel. This stops you passing the infection on to anyone else.
														<br>	3. Gently rub the cream into the infected area and surrounding skin. You'll usually need a small amount, depending on the size of the area you're treating. Be careful not to let the cream get into your eyes or mouth. If it does get into your eyes or mouth, rinse them with water.
														<br>	4. Wash your hands afterwards. This stops you spreading the infection to other parts of your body or other people.
														<br>	If you're using any other creams, ointments or lotions on the same area of skin, do not put them on at the same time as ketoconazole cream. After putting on the ketoconazole cream, wait 30 minutes before you use different products on the same area. This gives the ketoconazole time to be absorbed into your skin.</div>
