Walking barefoot in these places puts you at greater risk. Athlete’s foot usually occurs between your toes, but it can also affect the soles and sides of your feet.</div>
                <div class="guide" id="guide-1"><h3>Guide</h3>Apply the cream thinly to the affected area and smooth in gently. Repeat 2-3 times a day for up to 3 or 4 weeks to kill the root of the infection. The length of treatment may vary depending on the kind of infection you have.
														<br>
														<br>	❕Don’t forget❕
														<br>	Even if your symptoms seem to be clearing up, you should complete the full course of treatment to ensure the infection is treated.</div>

                <div class="description" id="desc-3"><h3>Description</h3>ChloRelief is an over-the-counter (OTC), non-steroidal lotion that is a first-aid treatment to any itch and rash. Calamine, one of the main ingredients of the lotion, has been proven for years to be mild, safe and effective in providing instant relief to itch and rash brought about by various factors such as insect bites or stings, sunburn, chickenpox, measles, razor burn, eczema or skin asthma, diaper rash, prickly heat, psoriasis, and itch as side effect of hemodialysis. ChloRelief also contains Eucalyptus extract that provides a mild cooling and calming effect to the skin</div>
                <div class="guide" id="guide-3"><h3>Guide</h3>The main benefit of calamine lotion is that it can relieve itchiness. Poisonous plants such as poison ivy, poison oak and poison sumac can cause itching and skin irritation. Calamine lotion for poison ivy and other poisonous plants can help relieve the itch, along with any pain or discomfort. In addition, it can help dry up any oozing or weeping that can develop on your skin due to the irritation. Other calamine lotion uses include:
														<br>
														<br>	• Bug bites: You can apply calamine lotion to insect bites and stings to help with mild reactions. Apply the lotion several times a day until your symptoms clear up or the bug bites are gone.
														<br>	• Chickenpox: You can use calamine lotion to help relieve the symptoms of this infectious condition. It can also prevent further skin infections.
														<br>	• Shingles: Along with antiviral medicines, you can use calamine lotion for shingles. Apply the lotion directly to your skin to get some relief from the symptoms of this condition.
														<br>	• Swimmer’s itch: You can use calamine lotion for rashes like swimmer’s itch. You can develop this skin condition if you swim in water containing certain parasites.
														<br>	• Heat rash: You can use calamine lotion for heat rash as well. A heat rash is an area of your skin that becomes irritated when sweat gets trapped in your pores and ducts beneath your skin.
														<br>	• Scabies: A small mite can cause a skin condition called scabies. To ease the itching from scabies, you can try applying calamine lotion. It can help relieve your symptoms but it won’t kill the mites.
														<br>	• Chigger bites: Chiggers are a type of mite that feeds on human skin. Their bites can cause skin irritation and itching. You can apply calamine lotion to help relieve the itching.
														<br>	• Acne: You may be able to use calamine lotion for acne. While it won’t treat your acne, it may help dry out a pimple if you use it as a spot treatment.
														<br>	• Hives: You can develop hives for many different reasons. Calamine lotion for hives can help relieve the itching caused by this skin condition.</div>

                <div class="guide" id="guide-6"><h3>Guide</h3>How to use ketoconazole cream
														<br>	1. Wash and dry the infected area of skin. If you're treating your feet, make sure you dry between your toes.
														<br>	2. Use your own towel or flannel. This stops you passing the infection on to anyone else.
														<br>	3. Gently rub the cream into the infected area and surrounding skin. You'll usually need a small amount, depending on the size of the area you're treating. Be careful not to let the cream get into your eyes or mouth. If it does get into your eyes or mouth, rinse them with water.
														<br>	4. Wash your hands afterwards. This stops you spreading the infection to other parts of your body or other people.
														<br>	If you're using any other creams, ointments or lotions on the same area of skin, do not put them on at the same time as ketoconazole cream. After putting on the ketoconazole cream, wait 30 minutes before you use different products on the same area. This gives the ketoconazole time to be absorbed into your skin.</div>
